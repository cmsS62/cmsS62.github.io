## Final Project Brainstorming


I am interested in pursuing the topic of Jewish Life in the 1920s in Berlin with Museum 4.0. An idea I would like to explore is creating an interactive storytelling interface on the web. I would like users to gain a glimpse of the daily lives and activities involved in Jewish culture at the time. Once I gather more information about this topic, I can focus on either a more curatorial concept or a personal narrative I want the audience to learn about. I want the story to be interspersed with features such as artwork, audio samples of music and soundscapes, maps, and letters and other forms of correspondence. These artifacts and media will help the project emphasize the vibrant nature of Jewish culture, as well as the impact of the activities and people in that time period on contemporary Berlin.

I found inspiration from [this](http://apps.rue89.com/haiti/en/) interactive storytelling website, which allows the user to select their path using buttons. Allowing the user to make decisions for the narrative's arc will make the archive more participatory for the user by giving them more control over the sequence of information presented to them.

Here is a sketch of a sample page in the narrative:
