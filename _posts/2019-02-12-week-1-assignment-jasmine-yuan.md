## Evaluating Archives - IUCN Red List


The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) is an archive containing information about the global conservation status of various natural organisms. It provides information about the ecology, habitat, and conservation actions for animal, plant, and fungi species. The inventory is updated constantly with assessments of new organisms, as well as re-assessments for organisms already existing on the site. The website encourages the audience to engage with the material, with options to take action by donating to the archive, contacting the organization, and following the archive on various social media platforms.

The archive is highly regarded as a source of reliable scientific information. According to its website, it is regularly cited in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and the intended audience appears to be government agencies, students, and other people or organizations interested in conservation. The IUCN Red List can also serve people who have an interest in the conservation and ecological information regarding a particular organism. 

The design of the archive invites exploration. A large search bar is centered on the front page, asking the user to enter names of species or regions. The user also has the option of clicking on an “advanced search” button, which allows them to select criteria options to find organisms. Below the search bar lies several images of featured “amazing species”, inviting the user to click on species icons to learn more about them. 

The archive is very large, but the website allows for options to help the user find the exact species they are looking for. Once the user enters a search query, search results can be sorted and filtered by several categories. The data on individual species is informative and descriptive and contains large graphics and summaries to assist the user in their search. The summaries contain hyperlinks that lead to more detailed information. I believe the hyperlinks are a good feature, because they invite the user to examine information at their own pace. Presenting a large amount of information upfront may alienate audiences who may not have as much background with ecological data.
