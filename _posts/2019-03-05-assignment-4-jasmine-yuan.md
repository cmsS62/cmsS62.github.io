## Final Project Conceptualization

### Updated Journey Map
The website begins by playing a random music selection. The user learns more about a key figure involved in the music, such as the composer or performer. They enter the network of the music community in Berlin in the 1920s through this figure. From there, the user experiences a “day in the life” of this person, and chooses a journey to follow as they explore different aspects of the music scene while learning more about their historical lives. I want the site to showcase the importance of music in defining Jewish communal identity and history.

### Making the archive more active: 
One idea I had of making the archive more participatory is to allow users to collect the music from the website into their own playlist. From there, they can group the songs in the playlist according to metadata such as the composers, performers, genre, and places performed. They can find connections between the music this way. 

### Core topics:
The main idea is to have the user explore the life of figures involved in the music scene as they navigate through: 

1. Popular music culture: Popular music trends, the “jazz age” & musical influences, and the life of Jewish performers in 1920s Germany - through the lens of Harry Frommermann (Jewish member and founder of the Comedian Harmonists)
2. Political satire, gender, and sexuality in the weimar cabaret - through the lenses of Curt Bois (performer), Valeska Gert (performer) and Friedrich Hollaender (composer). Focus on the Kabarett der Komiker, as the Comedian Harmonists performed there in October 1928
3. Concert music - lenses of Berta Geissmar (orchestra manager & secretary) and Franz Schreker (composer). The Comedian Harmonists make a crossover by performing popular music in concert halls. They are the first popular-music group to play in the Berlin Philharmonic hall.
4. Religious & synagogue music - music in sacred rituals, Jewish religious life, and the influence of synagogue music on popular song today. Focus on the New Synagogue.
