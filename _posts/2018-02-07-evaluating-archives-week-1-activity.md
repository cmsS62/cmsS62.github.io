## Evaluating Archives

**Criteria from class:**
You may choose several criteria from this list, or come up with your own.

- Is it clear what kind of materials are in the collection? 
- How easy is the interface to navigate?
- What is the organizing principle?
- How are the items contextualized? (Historically, socially, thematically, etc.)
- Who is the audience? (Are they casual viewers, specialized scholars, or someone else?)
- Does the archive make reference to a physical exhibition space?
- Does the archive provide direct access to the collection materials?
- How does the archive make its collection continuously relevant? Is it updated?
- Are there links to scholarship, writing, or events that involve the archive?
- How consistent is the archive across different sections, items, or pages?
- What tools does the archive offer for filtering, sorting, or reorganizing?
- What is the archive's aesthetic? Is the visual layout effective?
- What does the archive institution ask from you, and why? (Personal data, signup, surveys, advertising, etc)
- Who is the archive's curator? When and where did/does curation take place?
- What possibilities exist (within the interface) for creative or generative interaction with the archival materials? Is there a place to add/share your own insights?
- Is there social media integration, and how useful is it? Are there other ways to interact with fellow visitors?
- What are the possibilities and restrictions for exploration?
- Waht data are available? Missing? Hidden?
- How well does the interface suit the collection materials?
- How does the interface utilize non-visual sensation (such as sound, emotion, affect)?
- What is surprising about the archive?
- What aspects are strongest and weakest?
