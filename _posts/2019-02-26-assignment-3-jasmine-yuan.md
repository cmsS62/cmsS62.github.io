## Final Project Conceptualization

For this week, I decided to narrow the scope of the project to the music and music spaces of Jewish life in Berlin in the 1920s. The audience for the site will be English-speaking people who are interested in music, music history, and ethnomusicology. They are non-Berlin residents who will learn more about Berlin’s music scene, history, and architecture. 


### Use Cases

User A is interested in live music from 1920s Jewish culture performed in public settings. They want to learn more about practices in the Yiddish theater, cabaret, and music used in other formal and informal popular performance contexts. User A wants to investigate themes of political and social satire in Weimar era performances. 

User B is a music scholar who has an interest in ethnomusicology and music trends specific to Jewish composers in the 1920s. User B is interested in examining the community, market, and connections between Jewish-affiliated musicians, composers, producers, consumers, and record companies in Berlin. They also want to listen to music samples and learn about music writing processes.

User C is a student interested in learning more about liturgical music and music used in sacred and religious contexts. They want to listen to music, explore historic instruments performed in church services, and examine sheet music used in Jewish synagogues. 

User D is interested in modern and historic music spaces. They want to see floor plans, pictures of the exterior and interior of places specifically designed for live music performance, and explore architectural design processes for the acoustics of concert halls. 

### Journey Map

The screen can present a different page for each type of music space or concept. Users navigate to different panels on screens using interactive icons on the page. For example, a page on “Synagogue Music” can have three icons labelled “Music in the Service”, “Sheet Music”, and “Synagogue Acoustics and Architecture”, which users can click on to learn more about and interact with further. Users choose their own path at their own pace using buttons that lead them to different parts around Berlin’s music scene. The audience is presented with “Where do you want to go next?”, along with several choices of locations they have not explored yet.


### Notes and Sketches

Sketches:
This sketch shows various panels that would be presented to the user as they explore the interface and click around on the “Synagogue Music” page.
