## Johanna Drucker, Graphesis

The first section of the Drucker reading discusses the way meaning is communicated through graphic language. The introduction explores the idea of graphic languages as a tool to serve the humanities, which are based on interpretation and qualitative judgement. Drucker argues that because data does not have an inherent visual form, information visualizations act as arguments in graphical form. 

In “Visualizing uncertainty and interpretative cartography”, Drucker explores how graphical expressions of information are dependent on interpretation. I found the use of a “Trojan horse” analogy to describe graphical tools to be interesting, because it suggests that there is a deception involved in presenting information visualizations as data. The difference between observation and phenomena is emphasized, as there is inherent bias in the way information is presented visually. Because information visualizations are engaging to viewers, I believe they are powerful tools to informing and influencing public opinion. For example, US election maps use color to demonstrate voter results in different regions. If a map lacks nuance, it can convey misleading information and influence the partisan interpretation of viewers.
